# R-Machine-Learning-and-Analysis

This repository contains an R script to do some data cleaning of a movie dataset.

This repositrory also contains a Machine Learning script that uses a decision tree to classify a type of flower using it's petal length and petal width.

For people who would like to play around with the petal length and petal width, I have developed a script for an R Shiny application.
